# zmeshopt — prove libs/meshoptimizer is really unmodified upstream.
#
# UPSTREAM.md says the vendored tree is a pristine copy of a specific commit.
# On its own that is a claim in a markdown file: nothing stops an edit to
# libs/ from landing while the documentation still says otherwise. This script
# turns the claim into a check by fetching that exact commit and diffing.
#
# It is the reason a git submodule is not needed here. A submodule would have
# git record the upstream commit, which is genuinely useful — but Zig's package
# manager fetches a source archive and never resolves submodules, so consumers
# would receive an empty libs/ and a build that cannot work. This gets the
# guarantee without the breakage.
#
# The diff takes no exclusions. Upstream's src/ directory is vendored entire —
# the 20 translation units and the single public header — so "unmodified"
# means byte-identical rather than identical-modulo-a-list, and there is no
# list to fall out of date. What is left out is left out at the repository
# level (demo/, extern/, gltf/, js/, tools/, and the build glue) and never
# appears under libs/ at all.
#
# Needs network, so it is a separate CI job rather than part of ci/run.sh.
#
# Usage: ci/verify-vendor.sh
